Explain what the 'upstream' remote is usually used for, in your own words

Usually the upstream remote is a directory on a server where you hold a copy of your own repository. In case of a local crash you can easily clone the remote back to your own laptop.
It is also the central repo when more people are working on the same project.
It can also be used to make your repo publicly available.
